    <h1>TaskMaster - Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> September 2025</p>
    
    <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> TaskMaster stores your data locally on your device and does not collect personal information. We only collect anonymous crash reports and diagnostic data to improve app stability through Firebase Crashlytics.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>TaskMaster is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal information to ensure the app works properly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> We do not collect any personal information such as names, email addresses, or contact details.</li>
        <li><strong>Task Data:</strong> All your tasks, notes, and app content remain stored locally on your device only.</li>
        <li><strong>Crash and Diagnostic Data:</strong> We collect anonymous crash reports and technical diagnostic information through Firebase Crashlytics to help us identify and fix bugs. This includes:
            <ul>
                <li>App crash logs and stack traces</li>
                <li>Device model and operating system version</li>
                <li>App version information</li>
                <li>Performance metrics</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The crash data collected is anonymous and cannot be used to identify individual users.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify and fix crashes and bugs in the app</li>
        <li>Improve app performance and stability</li>
        <li>Monitor the overall health of the application</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your task data and personal content remain private and local to your device.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All your personal data (tasks, categories, settings, etc.) is stored locally on your device only. This data never leaves your device and is not synchronized with any external servers.</p>
    <p>Crash and diagnostic data is securely transmitted to and stored by Google Firebase services in accordance with Google's privacy and security standards.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>TaskMaster uses the following third-party service:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics (Google):</strong> For crash reporting and app stability monitoring. This service is governed by Google's Privacy Policy, which can be found at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use any advertising networks or other third-party analytics services.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share your personal data with any third parties. The only data shared is anonymous crash reports with Google Firebase Crashlytics for the purpose of improving app stability. This data cannot be used to identify individual users.</p>

    <h2>6. Internet Connection</h2>
    <p>TaskMaster works primarily offline and does not require an internet connection for core functionality. However, crash reports are automatically sent to Firebase Crashlytics when an internet connection is available. Your task data always remains on your device regardless of internet connectivity.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since all data remains on your device, the security of your information depends on your device's security measures. We recommend keeping your device secure with appropriate lock screens and security updates.</p>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>TaskMaster is safe for users of all ages. Since we don't collect any personal data, there are no privacy concerns regarding children's information.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>If future versions of TaskMaster introduce additional data collection features, we will update this privacy policy accordingly. The current version collects only anonymous crash and diagnostic data.</p>

    <h2>10. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we don't collect any personal data, there's no personal information to access, modify, or delete from our systems. All your task data remains under your complete control on your device.</p>
